//==================================================================================================
// DEFINITION:
// A synchronization primitive is "panic-safe" if it does not allow any `panic!` to leave the
// subject of synchronization in an inconsistent state.
// Please note that every `panic!` that occurs while a lock is acquired for writing can interrupt a
// series of operations somewhere in the middle, where invariants are not kept. Hence, the
// implementations in this module will always trigger a preconfigured "service stopper" in such
// situations (in order to mitigate inconsistent data access from subsequent calls, possibly from
// other threads).
// The vanilla `parking_lot` synchronization primitives are not panic-safe in any way, i.e. they
// simply release the lock when the stack in unwinding (without shutting down the application or
// at least "poisoning" the lock).
//==================================================================================================

/// Currently can be configured to provide the following features:
/// - Panic-safety (see the definition in a comment block above).
/// - Lock wait/hold timing measurements.
